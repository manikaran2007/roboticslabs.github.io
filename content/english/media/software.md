We devote effort to making scientific research more reproducible and making knowledge accessible to a broader population. Open-sourcing research software and datasets is one of our key practices. You can find open-source code and data out of our research in the [Publications](/publications) page. We highlight some public resources below:

- [MimicPlay](https://github.com/j96w/MimicPlay): a data generation system for scalable robot learning using human demonstrations
- [Eureka](https://github.com/eureka-research/Eureka): human-level reward design via coding large language models
- [Voyager](https://github.com/MineDojo/Voyager): an open-ended embodied agent with large language models
- [VIMA](https://github.com/vimalabs/VIMA): general robot manipulation with multimodal prompts
- [MineDojo](https://github.com/MineDojo/MineDojo): building open-ended embodied agents with Internet-scale knowledge
